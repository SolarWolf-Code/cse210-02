Team assignment for W03 of CSE 210

After being tasked with this week's team assignment, I created the HiLo game that a single player can play.


It is all done within Pthon and is handled by two classes. Those are class Card and class Game.

To play simply download the file and have all of the dependencies (Random is a imported libray from Python so you'll just need Python). 

The game goes like this:
A card number is given to you. This is a number between 1 and 13.
You have to guess if the next number will be higher or lower than the current one.
If you guess correctly, you are awarded 100 points.
Otherwise, if you guess wrong, you will lose 75 points.
If you have 0 or less points, the game is over.
You may chose whether to continue playing the game or not.
